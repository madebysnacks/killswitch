Kill Switch is a simple, but powerful plugin for Sketch that disables overrides for selected Symbols. This functionality enables a blank-slate approach to Symbol creation and override management that improves Symbol adoption and usage. This plugin does not collect any personal data, usage stats, nor analytics. It is purely intended to deliver quality of life improvements when creating and using Symbols in Sketch.
